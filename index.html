                    <p>A comprehensive car insurance policy, also known as motor package insurance, saves you money when your car is damaged in an accident or natural calamity. It also covers your vehicle against theft and burglary. At times, you may end up hurting others or damaging property in an accident. A car insurance policy covers such third-party liabilities as well. If you own a car in India, having third party car insurance is a must for you. That’s why it’s crucial to buy and renew your policy on time to stay on the right side of the law and be covered against car damages. At an affordable premium, our reliable car insurance policy protects you against all these risks so that you can drive worry-free. Apart from comprehensive car insurance, third-party only and own-damage only car insurance policies are also available. You can choose the policy type as per your needs.</p>

                                <p><strong>Comprehensive car insurance policy</strong></p>
                                <p>Comprehensive car insurance, also known as a private car package policy, is a type of
                                    auto insurance that provides complete coverage for your vehicle. It is an optional
                                    car insurance policy but is highly recommended for car owners who want the best
                                    protection for their four-wheelers.</p>
                                <p>Comprehensive car insurance covers damage caused by natural disasters, accidents,
                                    theft, fire, and other such incidents. It covers damages to both your vehicle and
                                    third-party vehicles and property. This car insurance policy also covers third-party
                                    liabilities, which will cover any legal costs or compensation you may be liable for
                                    in case of an accident caused due to your fault. In addition, some comprehensive
                                    policies also offer additional benefits such as roadside assistance, towing service
                                    and more. Even though comprehensive insurance policies tend to be more expensive
                                    than Third-Party Liability or Standalone Own Damage policies, but they offer broader
                                    coverage.</p>

                <p>Comprehensive car insurance is a more comprehensive policy that covers not only third-party liabilities but also damage to your own vehicle. On the other hand, third-party car insurance only covers legal liabilities in case of an accident. Comprehensive car insurance also offers add-ons like zero depreciation and roadside assistance, whereas third-party insurance only includes mandatory coverage as per law.</p>
                <p>Comprehensive car insurance has a higher premium as compared to third-party insurance, but it provides complete protection for your car. The choice between the two depends on your budget and the level of coverage you desire. You can easily buy car insurance online or offline, but third-party insurance is mandatory and needs to be purchased before registering a car.</p>

                        <li>
                           Third-party liability premium – this is stipulated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI), and it is directly proportional to your car’s cubic capacity.

                    <h4>Factors that affect these three components and your final car insurance price, include:</h4>
                    <ul class='first-div'>
                        <li>
                        IDV – IDV is the maximum amount you can claim under your policy. The higher your car’s market value, the higher your IDV and premium will be.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Make and model - Higher-end models are insured at a higher price, simply because the cost of repairs/replacement for such vehicle is higher.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Fuel type - Repairing petrol-fuelled cars is cheaper than those that run on diesel and CNG. As a result, they are also less expensive to insure.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Year of manufacture – Certain new cars may be costly to cover since their spare parts may not be available yet.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Location - Since urban areas have denser traffic, there’s a greater probability of accidental damages. Thus, your premium may vary depending on your location.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Claim history – If you have made no car insurance claims in the past year, you stand to gain a No Claim Bonus on your premium.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Add-ons – A small additional cost will be included in your premium for the add-ons you pick.
                        </li>
